                <p >Ocean pollution is a pressing environmental crisis threatening marine ecosystems. Human activities, especially plastic waste and chemical pollutants, are causing irreparable harm. Plastic debris endangers marine life, while chemicals disrupt ecosystems. Urgent global cooperation is needed to reduce plastic consumption, implement effective waste management, and promote sustainable practices. Heightened public awareness and responsible actions are crucial to preserving the health and balance of our oceans for future generations.</p>

                <p >Plastic pollution is a pervasive environmental challenge with far-reaching consequences. Millions of tons of plastic waste, largely non-biodegradable, flood our ecosystems annually. This ubiquitous material poses severe threats to wildlife, as animals often ingest or become entangled in plastic debris. Microplastics, resulting from the breakdown of larger items, further infiltrate the environment, entering food chains and potentially impacting human health. Combatting plastic pollution requires concerted global efforts, including reduced plastic consumption, improved recycling, and sustainable alternatives.</p>
